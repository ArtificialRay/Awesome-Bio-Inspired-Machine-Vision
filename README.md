# Awesome-Deep-Learning-For-Machine-Vision

A public collections of optimized machine vision approaches, mostly are in deep learning. Some of the approaches are code reproduction of a given repo in github, some are new output that is going to be published on academia(but still in evaluation). New works are welcome!!

So far we got three exciting works!!

**VisionRC**: A bio-inspired network that combines Reservoir computing(RC), Graph Neural Network(GNN), and vanilla deep learning approaches in machine vision. Click [here](https://github.com/ArtificialRay/Awesome-Bio-Inspired-Machine-Vision/tree/main/VisionRC)

**Deep SORT**: Optimize Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with Deep Learning approaches (e.g. YOLOv3) to enhance the tracking performance in complex environment. Click [here](

**MMactionForSF**: A dual-stream spatiotemporal architecture which utilize SlowFast network for human action recognition. Click [here](https://github.com/ArtificialRay/Awesome-Bio-Inspired-Machine-Vision/blob/main/MMactionForSF)
